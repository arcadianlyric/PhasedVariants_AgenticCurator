The study focused on types of cancer having a high incidence\nand mortality worldwide: breast, lung, colorectal and prostate. Data of the Web\nof Science (WOS) core collection database are used to retrieve articles related\nto sensor technologies and cancer research over 1991-2021 period. We utilized\nGephi software version 0.9.2 to visualize the co-word networks of the\ninteraction between sensor technologies and cancers under study. Results show\nmain clusters of interaction per typology of cancer. Biosensor is the only type\nof sensor that plays an essential role in all types of cancer: breast cancer,\nlung cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer. Electrochemical sensor is\napplied in all types of cancer under study except lung cancer. Electrochemical\nbiosensor is used in breast cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer research\nbut not colorectal cancer. Optical sensor can also be considered one of the\nsensor technologies that significantly is used in breast cancer, prostate\ncancer, and colorectal cancer. This study shows that this type of sensor is\napplied in more diversified approaches. Moreover, the oxygen sensor is mostly\nstudied in lung cancer and breast cancer due to the usage in breath analysis\nfor the treatment process. Finally, Cmos sensor is a technology used mainly in\nlung cancer and colorectal cancer. Results here suggest new directions for the\nevolution of science and technology of sensors in cancer research to support\ninnovation and research policy directed to new technological trajectories\nhaving a potential of accelerated growth and positive social impact for\ndiagnosis and treatments of cancer.",

Discovery of\nmutated driver pathways or gene sets is becoming an important step to\nunderstand molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis. However, systematically\ninvestigating commonalities and specificities of driver gene sets among\nmultiple cancer types is still a great challenge, but this investigation will\nundoubtedly benefit deciphering cancers and will be helpful for personalized\ntherapy and precision medicine in cancer treatment. In this study, we propose\ntwo optimization models to \\emph{de novo} discover common driver gene sets\namong multiple cancer types (ComMDP) and specific driver gene sets of one\ncertain or multiple cancer types to other cancers (SpeMDP), respectively. We\nfirst apply ComMDP and SpeMDP to simulated data to validate their efficiency.\nThen, we further apply these methods to 12 cancer types from The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) and obtain several biologically meaningful driver pathways. As\nexamples, we construct a common cancer pathway model for BRCA and OV, infer a\ncomplex driver pathway model for BRCA carcinogenesis based on common driver\ngene sets of BRCA with eight cancer types, and investigate specific driver\npathways of the liquid cancer lymphoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (LAML)\nversus other solid cancer types.

However, the\ncomplexity of data collection, classification, validation and processing result\nin cancer incidence figures often lagging two to three years behind the\ncalendar year. In response, national or regional population-based cancer\nregistries (PBCRs) are increasingly interested in methods for forecasting\ncancer incidence.

This study\naddresses the challenge of forecasting cancer incidence with incomplete data at\nboth regional and national levels. To achieve our objective, we propose the use\nof multivariate spatio-temporal shared component models that jointly model\nmortality data and available cancer incidence data. The performance of these\nmultivariate models are analyzed using lung cancer incidence data, together\nwith the number of deaths reported in England in the period 2001-2019.\nDifferent model predictive measures have been calculated to select the best\nmodel.",

          "summary": "In epidemiology research with cancer registry data, it is often of primary\ninterest to make inference on cancer death, not overall survival. Since cause\nof death is not easy to collect or is not necessarily reliable in cancer\nregistries, some special methodologies have been introduced and widely used by\nusing the concepts of the relative survival ratio and the net survival. In\nmaking inference of those measures, external life tables of the general\npopulation are utilized to adjust the impact of non-cancer death on overall\nsurvival. The validity of this adjustment relies on the assumption that\nmortality in the external life table approximates non-cancer mortality of\ncancer patients. However, the population used to calculate a life table may\ninclude cancer death and cancer patients. Sensitivity analysis proposed by\nTalb\\\"{a}ck and Dickman to address it requires additional information which is\noften not easily available. We propose a method to make inference on the net\nsurvival accounting for potential presence of cancer patients and cancer death\nin the life table for the general population. The idea of adjustment is to\nconsider correspondence of cancer mortality in the life table and that in the\ncancer registry. We realize a novel method to adjust cancer mortality in the\ncancer registry without any additional information to the standard analyses of\ncancer registries. Our simulation study revealed that the proposed method\nsuccessfully removed the bias. We illustrate the proposed method with the\ncancer registry data in England.",

Here, we develop a computational software combining Cox\nproportional-hazards model and stability-selection to unearth an overlooked,\nyet the most important cancer drivers hidden in massive data from The Cancer\nGenome Atlas (TCGA), including 11,574 RNAseq samples and clinic data.\nGenerally, noncoding RNAs primarily regulate cancer deaths and work as the\ndeadliest cancer inducers and repressors, in contrast to proteins as\nconventionally thought. Especially, processed-pseudogenes serve as the primary\ncancer inducers, while lincRNA and antisense RNAs dominate the repressors.\nStrikingly, noncoding RNAs serves as the universal strongest regulators for all\ncancer types although personal clinic variables such as alcohol and smoking\nsignificantly alter cancer genome. Furthermore, noncoding RNAs also work as\ncentral hubs in cancer regulatory network and as biomarkers to discriminate\ncancer types. Therefore, noncoding RNAs overall serve as the deadliest cancer\nregulators, which refreshes the basic concept of cancer mechanism and builds a\nnovel basis for cancer research and therapy.

Cancer driver genes drive\nthe development and progression of cancer, thus identifying cancer driver genes\nand their regulatory mechanism is crucial to the design of cancer treatment and\nintervention. Many computational methods, which take the advantages of computer\nscience and data science, have been developed to utilise multiple types of\ngenomic data to reveal cancer drivers and their regulatory mechanism behind\ncancer development and progression. Due to the complexity of the mechanistic\ninsight of cancer genes in driving cancer and the fast development of the\nfield, it is necessary to have a comprehensive review about the current\ncomputational methods for discovering different types of cancer drivers.\nResults: We survey computational methods for identifying cancer drivers from\ngenomic data. We categorise the methods into three groups, methods for single\ndriver identification, methods for driver module identification, and methods\nfor identifying personalised cancer drivers. We also conduct a case study to\ncompare the performance of the current methods. We further analyse the\nadvantages and limitations of the current methods, and discuss the challenges\nand future directions of the topic.

          "content": "Figure 1E further delves into the survival of Purinergic genes in KIRC samples, and the results of the analysis show that among the 19 Purinergic genes covered, the high expression of 12 Purinergic genes showed a negative correlation with the prognosis of KIRC patients. Particularly noteworthy were four Purinergic genes, P2RX5, GNAS, P2RX6, and P2RY11, which showed a significant association between their high expression in KIRC patients and poor patient prognosis (P < 0.001). In contrast, the [...] ADORA1 showed gain in 33 different types of cancers. PANX1, P2RY2, P2RY4, P2RY6, P2RX1, P2RX5, P2RX6, LPAR6, GNAZ, ADORA2A, ADORA2B showed a gain in 33 different types of cancer showed CNV deletion. Purinergic genes were present in 33 tumors with varying degrees of SNV, with Purinergic genes having the highest rate of SNV mutations in UCEC. mRNA expression profiles of Purinergic genes demonstrated the expression levels of these genes in 20 tumors. Among them, the greatest differences in mRNA [...] (Figure 5B). To further explore the effect of Purinergic genes on analysis (Figure 5C). The analysis showed that 12 out of 27 Purinergic genes were able to affect the prognosis of KIRC patients significantly. Among them, PANX1, P2RY6, P2RY2, ADORA1, P2RX6, P2RY11, P2RX5, ADORA2B, P2RX1, GNAS were risk factors (hazard ratio >1) and P2RY8, GNAI1 were protective factors (hazard ratio <1). We selected nine Purinergic genes with statistically significant (p < 0.05) effects on KIRC for co-expression",

Osteomyelitis, a severe skeletal infection, involves complex pathogenic 
mechanisms. Mitophagy (mitophagy) is crucial for cellular homeostasis and has 
been linked to various diseases, including osteomyelitis. This study explores 
the genetic basis of mitophagy in osteomyelitis, identifying differentially 
expressed genes related to mitophagy and their potential as biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets. Using the GSE30119 dataset from GEO, mRNA expression 
profiles from 49 osteomyelitis patients and 44 healthy individuals were 
analyzed. Differential gene expression analysis identified 2876 differentially 
expressed genes with a threshold of |log FC| > 0.5 and P < .05. 
Mitophagy-related genes were sourced from GeneCards, with 25 overlapping genes 
identified. Functional enrichment analyses, including gene ontology and Kyoto 
encyclopedia of genes and genomes, were conducted. Four machine learning models 
(generalized linear model, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme 
gradient boosting) identified 9 key genes for a diagnostic model. Gene set 
enrichment analysis and immune cell infiltration analysis using CIBERSORT were 
performed. Furthermore, RT-qPCR was performed to experimentally validate the 
expression patterns of the identified key genes in an inflammatory cellular 
model. Twenty-five intersecting genes were identified, with gene ontology and 
Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analyses highlighting their roles in 
autophagy and mitochondrial functions. The random forest model identified 9 key 
genes: BMP2KL, ALPK1, PGAM5, PINK1, TP53, GPC1, ITPKC, PEX3, and P2RX5, 
validated with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 
0.905. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated their involvement in metabolic and 
signaling pathways. Immune infiltration analysis revealed significant 
differences between patients and healthy individuals. RT-qPCR validation 
confirmed significant expression changes of the 9 key genes under inflammatory 
conditions, consistent with bioinformatics predictions. This study identifies 
key mitophagy genes and targets in osteomyelitis, providing a basis for future 
research and therapies.

BACKGROUND: Several putative susceptibility genes for familial papillary thyroid 
carcinoma, or familial non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (FNMTC), have been 
identified. However, in most families the molecular basis for FNMTC remains 
elusive.
METHODS: Two families with≥3 first-degree relatives in≥2 generations 
and≥2 unaffected relatives were selected. Germline DNA from 2 patients and 
2 unaffected individuals per family were analyzed by whole genome sequencing. 
All individuals were genotyped for putative pathogenic variants by Sanger 
sequencing, and minor allele frequency (MAF) was determined in 179 PTC-free 
European controls and the GnomAD database. Methylation analysis of candidate 
genes was carried out by EPIC BeadChips or pyrosequencing on germline and 
tumoral DNA.
RESULTS: Heterozygous variants in cancer-related genes expressed in thyroid 
tissue and predicted to impact protein function were identified in patients from 
both families. In F8, the best candidate was the P2RX5 p.Leu32Gln variant 
previously reported in another PTC family. However, its relatively high MAF in 
European controls (0.43%) casts doubt on its pathogenic role. In F17, the most 
relevant variant was c.345del in MST1R encoding the tyrosine kinase receptor 
RON. The variant is predicted to encode a truncated isoform. Further analysis of 
tumor and germline DNA showed no clear evidence of an expression switch from the 
long to the short oncogenic RON isoform.
CONCLUSION: Our data provide novel insight on the genetics of FNMTC. The P2RX5 
p.Leu32Gln variant should be considered either as low-penetrant or not 
associated with PTC predisposition. MST1R appears as a new putative 
susceptibility gene for FNMTC that warrants further consideration.

Next to adrenergic signalling, purinergic pathways mediated by extracellular 
adenine nucleotides have been described to shape thermogenic and metabolic 
functions in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here we describe high expression of 
P2X5 that is activated by ATP in mature adipocytes of BAT and differentiated 
brown adipocytes in vitro. The levels of other P2X family members were much 
lower, or expression was restricted to tissue-resident macrophages or 
endothelial cells. Global and brown adipocyte-specific P2rx5 deficiency resulted 
in lower expression of the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). However, indirect 
calorimetry studies showed that P2X5 did not affect systemic energy expenditure. 
Of note, glucose tolerance was impaired under chow and obesogenic high-fat diet 
conditions, which can be explained by lower glucose disposal into BAT but not 
into other organs. In summary, these data indicate a modulatory role of P2X5 in 
systemic and BAT-specific glucose metabolism.

AIM: The purpose of this research study was to develop and validate a gene 
signature based on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for predicting the 
time to the next relapse in multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: The GSE15245 dataset (N = 94) was divided into a training set (N = 65) 
and a testing set (N = 29). First, the training set was analyzed using weighted 
gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify key modules that were 
highly correlated with the timing of the next acute relapse. Subsequently, the 
hub genes within these key modules were subjected to univariate Cox regression 
analysis, and genes related to the recurrence time of MS were identified. The 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was used 
to refine the extraction further. Then, the gene signatures were constructed 
using multivariate Cox regression. The efficacy of the model that was based on 
the training set database was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves and validated using an independent testing set. Additionally, gene 
signatures were also validated for differential expression using an external 
independent dataset, GSE21942 (N = 29), along with experimental verification.
RESULT: Two key modules were identified with WGCNA. Univariate Cox regression 
analysis yielded 30 genes related to the relapse time of MS from these two 
modules, and then LASSO regression analysis further refined the selection to 
four genes, namely, BLK, P2RX5, GP1BA, and PF4. These four genes were used 
within the training dataset to build a Cox regression model, and this showed 
high prediction performance in the training as well as the testing datasets. 
Both external dataset analysis and experimental validation corroborated the 
differential expression of BLK and P2RX5 in patients with MS.
CONCLUSION: BLK, P2RX5, GP1BA, and PF4 emerge as potential predictors of future 
disease activity in individuals with MS.

In the fierce market competition, high-quality chicken products often stand out. 
There are significant differences in meat quality between yellow and white 
feathered chickens. However, the underlying mechanisms that lead to the 
differences in their meat quality remain unclear. Single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNP) are effective molecular markers that can be utilized in 
marker-assisted breeding programs targeting chicken meat quality traits. Our 
research findings indicated that the bloodline of yellow-feathered chickens can 
significantly alter the meat quality traits of chickens, especially in terms of 
the shear force and meat color of the breast muscle. Additionally, through 
metabolomic, lipidomic, and RNA-seq, we identified differentially expressed 
metabolites, lipids, and genes that influence meat quality. Furthermore, we 
discovered a key gene, the purinergic receptor P2 × 5 (P2RX5), which 
significantly contributes to meat quality traits. We identified five SNP sites 
within the P2RX5 gene and conducted genotyping. Three of these SNP sites were 
found to be significantly associated with meat quality traits in chickens, such 
as the a*value and cooking loss. These results indicated that our findings 
provide potential molecular markers for changing meat quality traits in 
chickens. However, due to our small sample size and the absence of testing on 
males, the generalizability of the results may be insufficient.

BACKGROUND: Localized prostate cancer (PCa) is a largely heterogeneous disease 
regarding its clinical behavior. Current risk stratification relies on 
clinicopathological parameters and distinguishing between indolent and 
aggressive cases remains challenging. To improve risk stratification, we aimed 
to identify new prognostic markers for PCa.
METHODS: We performed an in silico analysis on publicly available PCa 
transcriptome datasets. The top 20 prognostic genes were assessed in PCa tissue 
samples of our institutional cohort (n = 92) using the NanoString nCounter 
technology. The three most promising candidates were further assessed by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an institutional (n = 121) and an independent 
validation cohort from the EMPACT consortium (n = 199). Cancer-specific survival 
(CSS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were used as endpoints.
RESULTS: Our in silico analysis identified 113 prognostic genes. The prognostic 
values of seven of the top 20 genes were confirmed in our institutional radical 
prostatectomy (RPE) cohort. Low CENPO, P2RX5, ABCC5 as well as high ASF1B, 
NCAPH, UBE2C, and ZWINT gene expressions were associated with shorter CSS. IHC 
analysis confirmed the significant associations between NCAPH and UBE2C staining 
and worse CSS. In the external validation cohort, higher NCAPH and ZWINT protein 
expressions were associated with shorter PFS. The combination of the newly 
identified tissue protein markers improved standard risk stratification models, 
such as D'Amico, CAPRA, and Cambridge prognostic groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified and validated high tissue levels of NCAPH, UBE2C, and 
ZWINT as novel prognostic risk factors in clinically localized PCa patients. The 
use of these markers can improve routinely used risk estimation models.

Brown adipocytes are defined based on a distinct morphology and genetic 
signature that includes, amongst others, the expression of the Purinergic 2 
Receptor X5 (P2RX5). However, the role of P2RX5 in brown adipocyte and brown 
adipose tissue function is poorly characterized. In the present study, we 
conducted a metabolic characterization of P2RX5 knockout male mice; next, we 
characterized this purinergic pathway in a cell-autonomous context in brown 
adipocytes. We then tested the role of the P2RX5 receptor agonism in metabolic 
responses in vivo in conditions of minimal adaptive thermogenesis requirements. 
Our data show that loss of P2RX5 causes reduced brown adipocyte differentiation 
in vitro, and browning in vivo. Lastly, we unravel a previously unappreciated 
role for P2RX5 agonism to exert an anti-obesity effect in the presence of 
enhanced brown adipose tissue recruitment in male mice housed at 
thermoneutrality. Altogether, our data support a role for P2RX5 in mediating 
brown adipocyte differentiation and function that could be further targeted for 
benefits in the context of adipose tissue pathology and metabolic diseases.

Few neuropsychiatric disorders have replicable biomarkers, prompting 
high-resolution and large-scale molecular studies. However, we still lack 
consensus on a more foundational question: whether quantitative shifts in cell 
types-the functional unit of life-contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders. 
Leveraging advances in human brain single-cell methylomics, we deconvolve seven 
major cell types using bulk DNA methylation profiling across 1270 postmortem 
brains, including from individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, 
schizophrenia, and autism. We observe and replicate cell-type compositional 
shifts for Alzheimer's disease (endothelial cell loss), autism (increased 
microglia), and schizophrenia (decreased oligodendrocytes), and find age- and 
sex-related changes. Multiple layers of evidence indicate that endothelial cell 
loss contributes to Alzheimer's disease, with comparable effect size to APOE 
genotype among older people. Genome-wide association identified five genetic 
loci related to cell-type composition, involving plausible genes for the 
neurovascular unit (P2RX5 and TRPV3) and excitatory neurons (DPY30 and MEMO1). 
These results implicate specific cell-type shifts in the pathophysiology of 
neuropsychiatric disorders.

BACKGROUND: The function and regulation of miRNAs in progression of chordoma 
were unclear.
METHODS: Five miRNAs were identified by the machine learning method from the 
miRNA expression array. CCk-8 assay, EDU assay, wound healing migration assay, 
and trans-well assay were used to reveal the effect of the miRNAs in chordoma 
cell lines. Moreover, bioinformation analysis and the mRNA expression array 
between the primary chordomas and recurrent chordomas were used to find the 
target protein genes of miRNAs. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and luciferase reporter 
assay were used to verify the result.
RESULTS: miR-186-5p, miR-30c-5p, miR-151b, and miR-125b-5p could inhibit 
proliferation, migration, and invasion of chordoma while miR-1260a enhances 
proliferation, migration, and invasion of chordoma. Recurrent chordoma has a 
worse disease-free outcome than the primary chordoma patients. AMOT, NPTX1, 
RYR3, and P2RX5 were the target protein mRNAs of miR-186-5p; NPTX1 was the 
target protein mRNAs of miR-125b-5p; and AMOT and TNFSF14 were the target 
protein mRNAs of miR-1260a.
CONCLUSIONS: miR-186-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-1260a, and their target protein mRNAs 
including AMOT, NPTX1, RYR3, P2RX5, TNFSF14 may be the basement of chordoma 
research.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. In AD-associated 
neuroinflammation, astrocytes play a key role, finding glial activation both in 
patients and in animal models. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a neurolipid 
signaling system with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties 
implicated in AD. Astrocytes respond to external cannabinoid signals and also 
have their own cannabinoid signaling. Our main objective is to describe the 
cannabinoid signaling machinery present in hippocampal astrocytes from 3×Tg-AD 
mice to determine if they are actively involved in the neurodegenerative 
process. Primary cultures of astrocytes from the hippocampus of 3×Tg-AD and 
non-Tg offspring were carried out. We analyzed the gene expression of 
astrogliosis markers, the main components of the ECS and Ca2+ signaling. 3×Tg-AD 
hippocampal astrocytes show low inflammatory activity (Il1b, Il6, and Gls) and 
Ca2+ flow (P2rx5 and Mcu), associated with low cannabinoid signaling (Cnr1 and 
Cnr2). These results were more evident in females. Our study corroborates glial 
involvement in AD pathology, in which cannabinoid signaling plays an important 
role. 3×Tg-AD mice born with hippocampal astrocytes with differential gene 
expression of the ECS associated with an innate attenuation of their activity. 
In addition, we show that there are sex differences from birth in this AD 
animal, which should be considered when investigating the pathogenesis of the 
disease.

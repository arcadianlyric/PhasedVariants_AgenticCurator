BACKGROUND: Several putative susceptibility genes for familial papillary thyroid 
carcinoma, or familial non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (FNMTC), have been 
identified. However, in most families the molecular basis for FNMTC remains 
elusive.
METHODS: Two families with ≥ 3 first-degree relatives in ≥ 2 generations and ≥ 2 
unaffected relatives were selected. Germline DNA from 2 patients and 2 
unaffected individuals per family were analyzed by whole genome sequencing. All 
individuals were genotyped for putative pathogenic variants by Sanger 
sequencing, and minor allele frequency (MAF) was determined in 179 PTC-free 
European controls and the GnomAD data base. Methylation analysis of candidate 
genes was carried out by EPIC BeadChips or pyrosequencing on germline and 
tumoral DNA.
RESULTS: Heterozygous variants in cancer-related genes expressed in thyroid 
tissue and predicted to impact protein function were identified in patients from 
both families. In F8, the best candidate was the P2RX5 p.Leu32Gln variant 
previously reported in another PTC family. However, its relatively high MAF in 
European controls (0.43%) casts doubt on its pathogenic role. In F17, the most 
relevant variant was c.345del in MST1R encoding the tyrosine kinase receptor 
RON. The variant is predicted to encode a truncated isoform. Further analysis of 
tumor and germline DNA showed no clear evidence of an expression switch from the 
long to the short oncogenic RON isoform.
CONCLUSION: Our data provide novel insight on the genetics of FNMTC. The P2RX5 
p.Leu32Gln variant should be considered either as low-penetrant or not 
associated with PTC predisposition. MST1R appears as a new putative 
susceptibility gene for FNMTC that warrants further consideration.

Next to adrenergic signalling, purinergic pathways mediated by extracellular 
adenine nucleotides have been described to shape thermogenic and metabolic 
functions in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here we describe high expression of 
P2X5 that is activated by ATP in mature adipocytes of BAT and differentiated 
brown adipocytes in vitro. The levels of other P2X family members were much 
lower, or expression was restricted to tissue-resident macrophages or 
endothelial cells. Global and brown adipocyte-specific P2rx5 deficiency resulted 
in lower expression of the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). However, indirect 
calorimetry studies showed that P2X5 did not affect systemic energy expenditure. 
Of note, glucose tolerance was impaired under chow and obesogenic high-fat diet 
conditions, which can be explained by lower glucose disposal into BAT but not 
into other organs. In summary, these data indicate a modulatory role of P2X5 in 
systemic and BAT-specific glucose metabolism.

AIM: The purpose of this research study was to develop and validate a gene 
signature based on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for predicting the 
time to the next relapse in multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: The GSE15245 dataset (N = 94) was divided into a training set (N = 65) 
and a testing set (N = 29). First, the training set was analyzed using weighted 
gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify key modules that were 
highly correlated with the timing of the next acute relapse. Subsequently, the 
hub genes within these key modules were subjected to univariate Cox regression 
analysis, and genes related to the recurrence time of MS were identified. The 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was used 
to refine the extraction further. Then, the gene signatures were constructed 
using multivariate Cox regression. The efficacy of the model that was based on 
the training set database was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves and validated using an independent testing set. Additionally, gene 
signatures were also validated for differential expression using an external 
independent dataset, GSE21942 (N = 29), along with experimental verification.
RESULT: Two key modules were identified with WGCNA. Univariate Cox regression 
analysis yielded 30 genes related to the relapse time of MS from these two 
modules, and then LASSO regression analysis further refined the selection to 
four genes, namely, BLK, P2RX5, GP1BA, and PF4. These four genes were used 
within the training dataset to build a Cox regression model, and this showed 
high prediction performance in the training as well as the testing datasets. 
Both external dataset analysis and experimental validation corroborated the 
differential expression of BLK and P2RX5 in patients with MS.
CONCLUSION: BLK, P2RX5, GP1BA, and PF4 emerge as potential predictors of future 
disease activity in individuals with MS.

In the fierce market competition, high-quality chicken products often stand out. 
There are significant differences in meat quality between yellow and white 
feathered chickens. However, the underlying mechanisms that lead to the 
differences in their meat quality remain unclear. Single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNP) are effective molecular markers that can be utilized in 
marker-assisted breeding programs targeting chicken meat quality traits. Our 
research findings indicated that the bloodline of yellow-feathered chickens can 
significantly alter the meat quality traits of chickens, especially in terms of 
the shear force and meat color of the breast muscle. Additionally, through 
metabolomic, lipidomic, and RNA-seq, we identified differentially expressed 
metabolites, lipids, and genes that influence meat quality. Furthermore, we 
discovered a key gene, the purinergic receptor P2 × 5 (P2RX5), which 
significantly contributes to meat quality traits. We identified five SNP sites 
within the P2RX5 gene and conducted genotyping. Three of these SNP sites were 
found to be significantly associated with meat quality traits in chickens, such 
as the a*value and cooking loss. These results indicated that our findings 
provide potential molecular markers for changing meat quality traits in 
chickens. However, due to our small sample size and the absence of testing on 
males, the generalizability of the results may be insufficient.

BACKGROUND: Localized prostate cancer (PCa) is a largely heterogeneous disease 
regarding its clinical behavior. Current risk stratification relies on 
clinicopathological parameters and distinguishing between indolent and 
aggressive cases remains challenging. To improve risk stratification, we aimed 
to identify new prognostic markers for PCa.
METHODS: We performed an in silico analysis on publicly available PCa 
transcriptome datasets. The top 20 prognostic genes were assessed in PCa tissue 
samples of our institutional cohort (n = 92) using the NanoString nCounter 
technology. The three most promising candidates were further assessed by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an institutional (n = 121) and an independent 
validation cohort from the EMPACT consortium (n = 199). Cancer-specific survival 
(CSS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were used as endpoints.
RESULTS: Our in silico analysis identified 113 prognostic genes. The prognostic 
values of seven of the top 20 genes were confirmed in our institutional radical 
prostatectomy (RPE) cohort. Low CENPO, P2RX5, ABCC5 as well as high ASF1B, 
NCAPH, UBE2C, and ZWINT gene expressions were associated with shorter CSS. IHC 
analysis confirmed the significant associations between NCAPH and UBE2C staining 
and worse CSS. In the external validation cohort, higher NCAPH and ZWINT protein 
expressions were associated with shorter PFS. The combination of the newly 
identified tissue protein markers improved standard risk stratification models, 
such as D'Amico, CAPRA, and Cambridge prognostic groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified and validated high tissue levels of NCAPH, UBE2C, and 
ZWINT as novel prognostic risk factors in clinically localized PCa patients. The 
use of these markers can improve routinely used risk estimation models.

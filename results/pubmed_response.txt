BACKGROUND: Several putative susceptibility genes for familial papillary thyroid 
carcinoma, or familial non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (FNMTC), have been 
identified. However, in most families the molecular basis for FNMTC remains 
elusive.
METHODS: Two families with ≥ 3 first-degree relatives in ≥ 2 generations and ≥ 2 
unaffected relatives were selected. Germline DNA from 2 patients and 2 
unaffected individuals per family were analyzed by whole genome sequencing. All 
individuals were genotyped for putative pathogenic variants by Sanger 
sequencing, and minor allele frequency (MAF) was determined in 179 PTC-free 
European controls and the GnomAD data base. Methylation analysis of candidate 
genes was carried out by EPIC BeadChips or pyrosequencing on germline and 
tumoral DNA.
RESULTS: Heterozygous variants in cancer-related genes expressed in thyroid 
tissue and predicted to impact protein function were identified in patients from 
both families. In F8, the best candidate was the P2RX5 p.Leu32Gln variant 
previously reported in another PTC family. However, its relatively high MAF in 
European controls (0.43%) casts doubt on its pathogenic role. In F17, the most 
relevant variant was c.345del in MST1R encoding the tyrosine kinase receptor 
RON. The variant is predicted to encode a truncated isoform. Further analysis of 
tumor and germline DNA showed no clear evidence of an expression switch from the 
long to the short oncogenic RON isoform.
CONCLUSION: Our data provide novel insight on the genetics of FNMTC. The P2RX5 
p.Leu32Gln variant should be considered either as low-penetrant or not 
associated with PTC predisposition. MST1R appears as a new putative 
susceptibility gene for FNMTC that warrants further consideration.

Next to adrenergic signalling, purinergic pathways mediated by extracellular 
adenine nucleotides have been described to shape thermogenic and metabolic 
functions in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here we describe high expression of 
P2X5 that is activated by ATP in mature adipocytes of BAT and differentiated 
brown adipocytes in vitro. The levels of other P2X family members were much 
lower, or expression was restricted to tissue-resident macrophages or 
endothelial cells. Global and brown adipocyte-specific P2rx5 deficiency resulted 
in lower expression of the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). However, indirect 
calorimetry studies showed that P2X5 did not affect systemic energy expenditure. 
Of note, glucose tolerance was impaired under chow and obesogenic high-fat diet 
conditions, which can be explained by lower glucose disposal into BAT but not 
into other organs. In summary, these data indicate a modulatory role of P2X5 in 
systemic and BAT-specific glucose metabolism.

AIM: The purpose of this research study was to develop and validate a gene 
signature based on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for predicting the 
time to the next relapse in multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: The GSE15245 dataset (N = 94) was divided into a training set (N = 65) 
and a testing set (N = 29). First, the training set was analyzed using weighted 
gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify key modules that were 
highly correlated with the timing of the next acute relapse. Subsequently, the 
hub genes within these key modules were subjected to univariate Cox regression 
analysis, and genes related to the recurrence time of MS were identified. The 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was used 
to refine the extraction further. Then, the gene signatures were constructed 
using multivariate Cox regression. The efficacy of the model that was based on 
the training set database was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves and validated using an independent testing set. Additionally, gene 
signatures were also validated for differential expression using an external 
independent dataset, GSE21942 (N = 29), along with experimental verification.
RESULT: Two key modules were identified with WGCNA. Univariate Cox regression 
analysis yielded 30 genes related to the relapse time of MS from these two 
modules, and then LASSO regression analysis further refined the selection to 
four genes, namely, BLK, P2RX5, GP1BA, and PF4. These four genes were used 
within the training dataset to build a Cox regression model, and this showed 
high prediction performance in the training as well as the testing datasets. 
Both external dataset analysis and experimental validation corroborated the 
differential expression of BLK and P2RX5 in patients with MS.
CONCLUSION: BLK, P2RX5, GP1BA, and PF4 emerge as potential predictors of future 
disease activity in individuals with MS.

In the fierce market competition, high-quality chicken products often stand out. 
There are significant differences in meat quality between yellow and white 
feathered chickens. However, the underlying mechanisms that lead to the 
differences in their meat quality remain unclear. Single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNP) are effective molecular markers that can be utilized in 
marker-assisted breeding programs targeting chicken meat quality traits. Our 
research findings indicated that the bloodline of yellow-feathered chickens can 
significantly alter the meat quality traits of chickens, especially in terms of 
the shear force and meat color of the breast muscle. Additionally, through 
metabolomic, lipidomic, and RNA-seq, we identified differentially expressed 
metabolites, lipids, and genes that influence meat quality. Furthermore, we 
discovered a key gene, the purinergic receptor P2 × 5 (P2RX5), which 
significantly contributes to meat quality traits. We identified five SNP sites 
within the P2RX5 gene and conducted genotyping. Three of these SNP sites were 
found to be significantly associated with meat quality traits in chickens, such 
as the a*value and cooking loss. These results indicated that our findings 
provide potential molecular markers for changing meat quality traits in 
chickens. However, due to our small sample size and the absence of testing on 
males, the generalizability of the results may be insufficient.

BACKGROUND: Localized prostate cancer (PCa) is a largely heterogeneous disease 
regarding its clinical behavior. Current risk stratification relies on 
clinicopathological parameters and distinguishing between indolent and 
aggressive cases remains challenging. To improve risk stratification, we aimed 
to identify new prognostic markers for PCa.
METHODS: We performed an in silico analysis on publicly available PCa 
transcriptome datasets. The top 20 prognostic genes were assessed in PCa tissue 
samples of our institutional cohort (n = 92) using the NanoString nCounter 
technology. The three most promising candidates were further assessed by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an institutional (n = 121) and an independent 
validation cohort from the EMPACT consortium (n = 199). Cancer-specific survival 
(CSS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were used as endpoints.
RESULTS: Our in silico analysis identified 113 prognostic genes. The prognostic 
values of seven of the top 20 genes were confirmed in our institutional radical 
prostatectomy (RPE) cohort. Low CENPO, P2RX5, ABCC5 as well as high ASF1B, 
NCAPH, UBE2C, and ZWINT gene expressions were associated with shorter CSS. IHC 
analysis confirmed the significant associations between NCAPH and UBE2C staining 
and worse CSS. In the external validation cohort, higher NCAPH and ZWINT protein 
expressions were associated with shorter PFS. The combination of the newly 
identified tissue protein markers improved standard risk stratification models, 
such as D'Amico, CAPRA, and Cambridge prognostic groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified and validated high tissue levels of NCAPH, UBE2C, and 
ZWINT as novel prognostic risk factors in clinically localized PCa patients. The 
use of these markers can improve routinely used risk estimation models.

BACKGROUND: Older adults often have multiple morbidities that may lead to 
polypharmacy. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 has shown significant contributions in 
the metabolism of various medications; however, its related drug-drug 
interactions (DDIs) appear to be underrecognized in clinical practice compared 
to the major CYP enzymes (eg, CYP3A4, CYP2D6). This review summarizes the 
progress of CYP2C8-mediated DDIs and factors influencing the interaction 
magnitude.
METHODS: Using CYP2C8 and drug interactions as the search terms, literature was 
searched through PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase as of January 2025. Eligible 
studies were identified following PRISMA guidelines. Screening and inclusion 
were assessed by two independent reviewers and 57 studies met 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Based on authoritative sources (FDA, EMA, DrugBank), and literature, 
this review identified 5 inducers, 53 strong/moderate inhibitors, and 32 
major/intermediate substrates of CYP2C8. Typical examples were illustrated to 
predict DDIs by in vitro-in vivo extrapolation. The factors influencing DDI 
magnitude include genetic polymorphisms (CYP2C8, SLCO1B1, 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, and pregnane X receptor), hepatic and renal 
function, properties of CYP2C8 perpetrators (dose, treatment course, systemic 
concentrations, time after discontinuation, inhibitory potency, inhibitory 
abilities of metabolites on CYP2C8), properties of object drugs (whether the 
active metabolite of object drug is a CYP2C8 substrate, therapeutic index, 
stereoselectivity), differences in DDI risk for drugs from similar therapeutic 
classes, and whether multiple interaction mechanisms are involved. Some 
botanical supplements showed potential to influence CYP2C8 in vitro or in animal 
experiments.
CONCLUSION: CYP2C8 is an important but underrecognized DME. This article 
reviewed its main substrates, perpetrators, DDIs, and methods for predicting 
interactions, and provided the first comprehensive summary of the factors 
influencing the interaction magnitude. Such knowledge will enhance the awareness 
of clinical professionals regarding safe medication for older adults. Further 
advances will emerge if the gaps in current knowledge and priorities for future 
research are recognized.

An Emerald-Colored Intoxication: A Case of Sulfhemoglobinemia Induced by 
Metoclopramide.

Sulfhemoglobinemia (SulfHb) is a rare condition characterized by the presence of 
sulfhemoglobin in the blood, resulting from the incorporation of a sulfur atom 
into the hemoglobin molecule. This alteration prevents hemoglobin from 
effectively binding and transporting oxygen, leading to clinical symptoms such 
as cyanosis and tissue hypoxia. We report the case of a 59-year-old female 
patient who was admitted to the emergency department for desaturation. The 
patient presented with persistent lip cyanosis and exertional dyspnea over 
several months. Blood analyses revealed leukocytosis and the detection of 
sulfhemoglobin. A diagnosis of SulfHb induced by metoclopramide intoxication was 
established. The treatment involved discontinuing metoclopramide and 
administering oxygen. The patient was subsequently monitored monthly during 
outpatient consultations, and the sulfhemoglobin levels were no longer 
detectable three months after discharge. This case highlights the synergy 
between metoclopramide overdose, CYP2D6 inhibition by duloxetine, and exposure 
to sulfur donors in promoting sulfhemoglobin formation. It underscores the 
importance of a systematic medication review and the early use of co-oximetry in 
any unexplained desaturation to avoid diagnostic and management delays. The case 
underscores the importance of vigilance in prescribing and monitoring 
pharmacological treatments. Rapid recognition of SulfHb and the utilization of 
appropriate diagnostic tools are essential to ensure optimal patient care.

Schizophrenia is a neuropsychiatric disorder caused by neurochemical 
alterations, non-genetic, genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. 
Pharmacoepigenetics studies the relationship between epigenetic variability and 
response to drugs. The objective was to realize a descriptive review of the 
current state of knowledge on epigenetic molecular mechanisms in pharmacogenes 
encoding metabolizing enzymes of second-generation antipsychotics drugs used in 
schizophrenia and their clinical implications. A brief description of the 
pharmacogenes CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, enzymes and metabolism 
of second-generation antipsychotic drugs (SGAs) such as clozapine, olanzapine, 
risperidone, paliperidone and quetiapine was made. The central review was on the 
epigenetic molecular mechanisms of DNA methylation, histone methylation and 
acetylation of pharmacogenes, likewise, epigenetic changes due to 
enzyme-inducing drugs and SGAs, and their clinical implications, were described. 
Despite the limited scientific literature published on the epigenetics that 
regulate pharmacogenes, it has been shown that DNA methylation and histone 
trimethylation and acetylation are the main epigenetic mechanisms in 
pharmacogenes, alike, some enzyme-inducing drugs would promote epigenetic 
changes. This review has clinical implications for the medical-clinical care and 
treatment of schizophrenia.

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) package 
insert for clozapine states that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 is important in 
clozapine metabolism, implying that CYP2D6 genotypes should be considered in 
clozapine dosing. We investigated differences for clozapine 
concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratios, as a pharmacokinetic measure, in relation to 
CYP2D6 phenotype.
STUDY DESIGN: Linear mixed-effect regression models were applied to investigate 
the association between genotype-predicted CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotypes and C/D 
ratios including the effects of age, sex, smoking, and sampling time in a pooled 
sample of three cohorts, both without and with adjusting for the interaction 
between cohort and CYP2D6 phenotype, as well as in separate models stratified by 
cohort.
STUDY RESULTS: We included 897 patients from three cohorts with a total of 
10 428 clozapine and norclozapine measurements. We found no association between 
CYP2D6 phenotypes and clozapine or norclozapine C/D ratios or 
clozapine-to-norclozapine ratios in the pooled sample with or without adjustment 
for the interaction between cohort and CYP2D6 phenotype nor when analyzing three 
cohorts separately (P>.05 in all cases). Older patients and females had higher 
C/D ratios of clozapine and norclozapine (P<.001, P<.001, P<.001 and P=.02), 
whereas smokers had lower C/D ratios of clozapine and norclozapine as well as 
clozapine-to-norclozapine ratios (P<.001 for all three).
CONCLUSIONS: We reported no association between CYP2D6 genotype-predicted 
phenotypes and clozapine pharmacokinetics. Dose adjustment based on CYP2D6 
genotyping is unlikely to be helpful in managing clozapine-treated patients. We 
propose that the current FDA package insert should be updated to avoid 
misleading prescribers.

Given the critical roles played by human cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) in drug 
metabolism, accurately predicting their potential inhibition and induction by 
drugs and drug candidates is a key objective for improving drug development and 
safety assessment. Traditional experimental methods for identifying CYP 
modulators are labor-intensive and costly, underscoring the need for efficient 
in silico prediction models. In this study, we present an advanced deep learning 
model for predicting CYP inhibition, with a primary focus on key enzymes 
involved in drug metabolism: CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. This 
model integrates deep neural networks with principal component analysis (PCA) 
and the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), and it demonstrates 
excellent predictive performance. Furthermore, we developed a novel 
classification model capable of accurately distinguishing compounds as strong 
inhibitors, moderate inhibitors, or noninhibitors for these CYPs, achieving 
robust and reliable overall performance. Through statistical analysis, we also 
identified structural alerts (SAs) associated with CYP inhibition and strong 
CYP3A4 induction, providing a more precise characterization than previous 
approaches. Finally, we introduced a novel deep learning-based method 
specifically designed to predict human pregnane X receptor (hPXR) activation, a 
major mechanism responsible for CYP induction, which also achieved good 
performance.
